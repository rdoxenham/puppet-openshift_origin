# puppet-openshift_origin

# About

This repository is a fork of the OpenShift Origin code to allow installation of OpenShift Enterprise v1.2 using Puppet/Foreman. This is an early and non-supported release and is for testing at this stage only.

This module helps install [OpenShift Origin](https://openshift.redhat.com/community/open-source) Platform As A Service.
Through the declaration of the `openshift_origin` class, you can configure the OpenShift Origin Broker, Node and support
services including ActiveMQ, Qpid, MongoDB, named and OS settings including firewall, startup services, and ntp.

# Requirements

* Puppet >= 2.7
* Facter >= 1.6.17
* Puppetlabs/stdlib module.  Can be obtained
  [here](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib) or with the command
  `puppet module install puppetlabs/stdlib`
* Puppetlabs/ntp module.  Can be obtained
  [here](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/ntp) or with the command

# Installation

The module can be obtained from the
[github repository](https://github.com/rdoxenham/puppet-openshift_origin).

1. Download the [Zip file from github](https://github.com/kraman/puppet-openshift_origin/archive/master.zip)
1. Upload the Zip file to your Puppet Master.
1. Unzip the file.  This will create a new directory called puppet-openshift_origin-{commit hash}
1. Rename this directory to just `openshift_origin` and place it in your
	   [modulepath](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/modules1.html#modules).

# Configuration

There is one class (`openshift_origin`) that needs to be declared on all nodes managing
any component of OpenShift Origin. These nodes are configured using the parameters of
this class.

## Using Parameterized Classes

[Using Parameterized Classes](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/parameterized_classes.html)

### Example: Single host (broker+console+node) which uses the Avahi MDNS and mongo Auth plugin:

    class { 'openshift_origin' :
      node_fqdn                  => "${hostname}.${domain}",
      cloud_domain               => 'openshift.local',
      dns_servers                => ['8.8.8.8'],
      os_unmanaged_users         => [],
      enable_network_services    => true,
      configure_firewall         => true,
      configure_ntp              => true,
      configure_activemq         => true,
      configure_mongodb          => true,
      configure_named            => false,
      configure_avahi            => true,
      configure_broker           => true,
      configure_node             => true,
      development_mode           => true,
      update_network_dns_servers => false,
      avahi_ipaddress            => '127.0.0.1',
      broker_dns_plugin          => 'avahi',
    }

### Example: Single host (broker+console+node) which uses the **Kerberos** Auth plugin and GSS-TSIG. 

    class { 'openshift_origin' :
      node_fqdn                  => "${hostname}.${domain}",
      cloud_domain               => 'openshift.local',
      dns_servers                => ['8.8.8.8'],
      os_unmanaged_users         => [],
      enable_network_services    => true,
      configure_firewall         => true,
      configure_ntp              => true,
      configure_activemq         => true,
      configure_mongodb          => true,
      configure_named            => false,
      configure_avahi            => true,
      configure_broker           => true,
      configure_node             => true,
      development_mode           => true,
      broker_auth_plugin         => 'kerberos',
      broker_dns_plugin          => 'nsupdate',
      broker_dns_gsstsig         => true,
      http_kerberos_keytab       => '/etc/http.keytab',
      dns_kerberos_keytab        => '/etc/dns.keytab'
      kerberos_realm             => 'EXAMPLE.COM',
      kerberos_service           => $node_fqdn,
    }

Please note:

* The Broker needs to be enrolled in the KDC as a host, `host/node_fqdn` as well as a service, `HTTP/node_fqdn`
* Keytab should be generated, is located on the Broker machine, and Apache should be able to access it (`chown apache <kerberos_keytab>`)
* Like the example config below:
  * set `broker_auth_plugin` to `'kerberos'`
  * set `http_kerberos_keytab` and `dns_kerberos_keytab` to the absolute file location of the keytab
  * set `kerberos_realm` to the kerberos realm that the Broker host is enrolled with
  * set `kerberos_service` to the FQDN of the enrolled kerberos service, e.g. `node_fqdn`
* After setup, to test:
  * authentication: `kinit <user>` then `curl -Ik --negotiate -u : <node_fqdn>`
  * GSS-TSIG (should return `nil`):
    `$ cd /var/www/openshift/broker`
    `$ bundle --local`
    `$ rails console`
    `$ d = OpenShift::DnsService.instance`
    `$ d.register_application "appname", "namespace", "node_fqdn"`
    `=> nil`
* For any errors, on the Broker, check `/var/log/openshift/broker/httpd/error_log`.
